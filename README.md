reval: repeated function evaluation for sensitivity analysis
============================================================

`reval` is a small utility package for repeated function evaluations in R. It 
is designed to simplify scenario testing and sensitivity analysis. 
The package supports one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) sensitivity analysis, 
evaluation of parameter sets and (sampled) parameter permutation. Options for 
formatting output are also provided.
