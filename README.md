reval: repeated function evaluation for sensitivity analysis
============================================================

`reval` is a small utility package for repeated function evaluations in R. It 
is designed to simplify scenario testing and sensitivity analysis. The package
currently supports one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) sensitivity analysis (parameter
sampling and permutation are planned for future versions). A function for 
collating outputs is also provided.
