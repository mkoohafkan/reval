reval: repeated function evaluation for sensitivity analysis
============================================================

`reval` is a small utility package for repeated function evaluations in R. It 
is designed to simplify scenario testing and sensitivity analysis. The package
currently supports one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) sensitivity analysis and 
parameter set evaluation (parameter permutation and sampling are planned for 
future versions).
